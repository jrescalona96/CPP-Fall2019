# Project #1 : Job Scheduler

### Simulating Job Scheduler of the Operating Systems

- a. First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
- b. Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
- c. Round-Robin with Time Slice = 2 (RR-2)
- d. Round-Robin with Time Slice = 5 (PR-5)

You can use either Java or your choice of programming language for the implementation. The objective of this project is to help student understand how above four job scheduling algorithms operates by implementing the algorithms, and conducting a performance analysis of them based on the performance measure of their average turnaround times (of all jobs) for each scheduling algorithm using multiple inputs. Output the details of each algorithmâ€™s execution. You need to show which jobs are selected at what times as well as their starting and stopping burst values. You can choose your display format, for examples, you can display the results of each in **Schedule Table** or **Gantt Chart** format (as shown in the class notes). The project will be divided into three parts (phases) to help you to accomplish above tasks in in a systematic and scientific fashion: Design and Testing, Implementation, and Performance Analysis.

The program will read process burst times from a file (job.txt) â€“ this file will be generated by you. Note that you need to generate multiple testing cases (with **inputs of 5 jobs, 10 jobs, 15 jobs, 20 jobs, 25 jobs and 30 jobs**). A sample input file of five jobs is given as follows (burst time in ms):

> [Begin of job.txt]
>
> Job1
>
> 7
>
> Job2
>
> 18
>
> Job3
>
> 10
>
> Job4
>
> 4
>
> Job5
>
> 12
>
> [End of job.txt]

## Round Robin : slices = 2 & slice = 5

> startTime = 0, endtime = 0, slice = time per job

> > pop burstTime

> > let timeLeft = burstTime - slice

> > startTime = endTime

> > endTime = startTime + timeUsed

> > if burstTime > 0, push to Queue
> >
> > else push time to results array
> >
> > log results then average array
